# Blog3

This is the reposity where I will be storing my data and code for Blogs 3a-c, which involves finding some data, performing exploratory data analysis, and discovering what story the data tells us.

The files in this repository are as follows:
1. Blog3.ipynb : the python notebook where I gathered and cleaned the data
2. TaylorSwiftSongs.csv : a csv with the final cleaned data

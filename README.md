# Blog_3

This is the reposity where I will be storing my data and code for Blogs 3a-c, which involves finding some data, performing exploratory data analysis, and discovering what story the data tells us.

The files in this repository are as follows:
1. `Blog 3 Data.ipynb`: the python notebook where I gathered and cleaned the data
2. `TaylorSwiftSongs.csv`: a csv with the final cleaned data
3. `EDA (Data Visualization).ipynb`: the python notebook where I created the exploratory figures
4. `Summary Graphic.ipync`: the python notebook where I create the final graphics for the data storytelling post
